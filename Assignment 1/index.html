        <li class="start">CSS describes how HTML elements are to be diplayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="linethrough">css is not necessary</span><span class="background">CSS saves a lot of work.</span><span class="start">It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once.</span></li><br>

    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="star">
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attributes inside HTML element</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head'<section></section></li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external css file </li>

                use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier

    when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS  class applies a style to multiple elements, ID,
    on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element,Id is also
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element
    and it's used by JavaScript.
